    :tickets: 5648

    The support for pool ping listeners to receive exception events via the
    :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.handle_error` event added in 2.0.0b1 for
    :ticket:`5648` failed to take into account dialect-specific ping routines
    such as that of MySQL and PostgreSQL. The dialect feature has been reworked
    so that all dialects participate within event handling.

    For this release, third party dialects which implement a custom
    :meth:`_engine.Dialect.do_ping` method can opt in to the newly improved
    behavior by having their method no longer catch exceptions or check
    exceptions for "is_disconnect", instead just propagating all exceptions
    outwards. Checking the exception for "is_disconnect" is now done by an
    enclosing method on the default dialect, which ensures that the event hook
    is invoked for all exception scenarios before testing the exception as a
    "disconnect" exception. If an existing ``do_ping()`` method continues to
    catch exceptions and check "is_disconnect", it will continue to work as it
    did previously, but ``handle_error`` hooks will not have access to the
    exception if it isn't propagated outwards.
